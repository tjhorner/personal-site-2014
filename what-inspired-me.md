# What inspired me to code?
###### (basically I reveal all of my embarassing moments)

Going back to when I was 7, I had my HP Pavilion Media Center PC m7000. I was on YouTube looking at random things when I saw an ActionScript tutorial on how to change your cursor inside of a Flash animation. I thought this was amazing, I could get my own stuff on the screen like that. After that, I looked into website creation. At first, I used WYSIWYG editors (first being freewebs.com). I wanted to actually "make" it though. I looked up "how to make webpage" on Google and went through some basic HTML tutorials. I find some other tutorials and follow them completely. I was a Google nerd even back then, I tried all the beta stuff for Google like Google Docs. I literally copy-pasted the website into a Google Doc and edited it. Seriously.

A few years later, I saw [Tinkernut's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ct6emxVR9w) on how to make a website (he redid them though). I followed them from there and I still have the original code, I can host it if anybody wants me to. My interest just shot up from there; I had the urge to _create_.
